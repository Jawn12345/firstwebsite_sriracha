      Sriracha is a go-to sauce for a lot of dishes. It is great on burgers,
        noodles, rice and many other dishes. Why have a Ketchup versus Mayo
        debate when Sriracha is clearly the winner. Everyone should have some
        spice in their lives. Sriracha is super <b>HOT</b>, so hot that other
        brands have incorporated Sriracha into their own sauces. Heinz, a famous
        condiment known for their Ketchup, created a
        <a href="https://www.heinz.com/product/00013000006095"> Sriracha
        flavored Ketchup</a>. Spicy Mayo? Literally Mayonnaise mixed with
        Sriracha, and the <i>only</i> acceptable form of Mayo. There are a lot
        of benefits with adding Sriracha to almost everything that we eat.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;"> <u>Happiness</u> </h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:center;">
    	When the human tongue comes into contact with spices and spicy sauces,
        like Sriracha, the receptors in both the tongue and the nose activates
        a sensation of pain and heat. The body then releases <b>endorphins,
        dopamine, and serotonin.</b> <br>
      <b>Endorphins</b> mainly focuses on dealing with stress and reducing pain, like
        after the body comes into contact with something spicy. Endorphins are
        essentially natural painkillers and can leave you with a "high" as
        response to combat the pain. These hormones are also release during other
        pleasurable activities, such as exercise and sex.<br>
      <b>Serotonin</b>, on the other hand, deals with stabilizing mood. It helps with
        reducing stress and anger, and it even helps with depression.<br>
      Lastly, <b>dopamine</b> is released when we are doing something pleasurable. All
      of these hormones serve to create happiness within ourselves and our body.

    <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:center;">
      	Eating spicy food can be <i>beneficial</i> for your body. Studies have shown
      	that eating spice can help <b>boost heart health, lose weight, and aid
        in digestion.</b> Spices have been found to be able to make people fill
        full faster, reducing the amount of food intake and prevent overeating.

    <p style="font-family:verdana;text-align:center;">
        Sriracha is one of the milder hot sauces out there. You can enjoy some

        <i>natural preservatives</i> that allow the sauce to stay fresh for a long
        period of time.

        As a wise man once said, <b>"no pain no gain"</b> and <b>"no pain no
        pleasure."</b> Now go out and buy a bottle of Sriracha, if you don't own
        one already to spice up your life, to improve your happiness and health.
